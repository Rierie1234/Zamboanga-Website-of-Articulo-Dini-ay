              <p class="description"> The Zamboanga has a very intersting history too, just like other place,Zamboanga's story is one of cultural fusion and historical intrigue. From its ancient roots with the Subanen people in the 12th or 13th century to its later Islamic influence brought by the Tausūg migration, the region has been a crossroads of civilizations. Speculation abounds regarding its ties to ancient Chinese polities, adding layers of mystery to its narrative. Despite the debates over its etymology, Zamboanga's significance was solidified when Spain established a settlement there in 1569, shaping its trajectory as a vibrant city with a complex past.</p></body>

                <p class="history">The Zamboanga Peninsula, settled by the Subanen people in the 12th or 13th century, was also home to the ancestors of the Yakan, Balanguingui, and other related Sama-Bajau peoples. There's historical speculation linking it to a polity called "Sanmalan" mentioned in 11th-century Chinese records</p>
                    <p class="history2">   The Tausūg people migrated there in the 13th century, becoming dominant after Islamization in the 14th century. The city, known as Samboangan in historical records, later became Zamboanga. The city's nickname "City of Flowers" is derived from such folk etymologies. There are debates over its name's origin, with some suggesting it's from the Sinama word for "mooring place," while others propose an Indonesian origin. .Zamboanga was chosen in 1569 as the site of the Spanish settlement and garrison on La Caldera (now part of Barangay Recodo). Spain granted the former Rajahnate of Sanmalan protectorate status against the Sulu Sultanate, its former overlord and the kingdom's name was hispanized into Zamboanga and made a city.</p>
