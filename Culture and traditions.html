     <h2 style=text-align:center><p class="title4">Chavacano</p></h2>
      <p class="chav">Nowadays, chavacano, a creole based on Spanish, is extensively spoken in Zamboanga City, in the southern region of the Philippines. Because it is the only creole language with Spanish roots spoken outside of the Americas, Zamboanga has come to be known as "Asia's Latin City." But like other languages, Chavacano has spread throughout the nation through local migration, which is brought on by a number of variables like work and education. As a result, not only do the inhabitants of Zamboanga use Cebu City or Province as a regular destination, but also other local migrants in general, as Cebuano is the primary native language of the Philippines.</p></body>
